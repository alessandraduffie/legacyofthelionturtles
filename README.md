This is a script written to gather data on stat distribution for a tabletop role top playing game I am currently developing.
These files were created in mid 2018 on my home system, and calculations were made based on the second version of the game.

The functions work when called in Google Chrome's console.
Due to as of yet unsolved errors, the on page function call buttons do not result in values displayed in the given text fields.
